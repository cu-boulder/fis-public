Dear ReplaceMe1 ReplaceMe2,

The registration phase for the ORCID initiative on the Boulder campus has
begun! 
Faculty Affairs is creating ORCID iDs for all active faculty members at
CU-Boulder with appointments in these groups: tenure-track faculty,
instructors, clinical faculty, and research faculty. 
Action Requested 
•	You will receive an email within the next 24-48 hours from ORCID
(www.orcid.org) asking you to claim your newly created ORCID iD. 
•	Faculty Affairs has initiated this registration for all faculty at
CU-Boulder. 
•	Please follow the steps outlined in the email you will receive from
claim@notify.orcid.org to claim your ORCID iD. Your login to orcid.org will
be: elsborg@colorado.edu 
•	You may add scholarly works to your ORCID profile if you desire;
however, this is voluntary. CU-Boulder will continue to focus faculty efforts
through the VIVO profiles (http://vivo.colorado.edu/) which may be updated
using the FRPA application accessible through the CU portal Faculty Report of
Professional Activities - FRPA . 
If you have a pre-existing ORCID iD, follow these steps: 
1. Do not claim the newly created ORCID iD.
2. Include the URL for your existing ORCID iD in a reply to this email.
3. The new, unclaimed ORCID iD will be deactivated by our team so you do not
end up with multiple ORCID iDs.
What Will Show on Your ORCID Profile 
•	Your ORCID iD: in this format - http//orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-XXXX 
•	Your Name: ReplaceMe1 ReplaceMe2 
•	Your CU Boulder email used for ORCID registration:
ReplaceMe0@colorado.edu 
(Your email is set to private and not visible unless you change the setting to
public.) 
•	Employment affiliation to the University of Colorado Boulder 
About our CU-Boulder ORCID initiative 
•	The initial scope of our ORCID implementation is to create ORCID iDs
en masse for our faculty to populate ORCID iDs in the data systems for
manuscript and grant submission processes to assist with proper attribution of
scholarly works. 
•	Future value for reading data from ORCID or populating data from VIVO
to ORCID will be evaluated. Other data connections will be streamlined as best
we can to make the most of the data already collected. 
•	If you missed the campus communication ememo on the ORCID iD project,
please see the full information here: E-Memo on ORCID from the Office of the
Provost and the Office of the Dean of the University Libraries 
What is ORCID? 
•	The ORCID registry is a “non-profit, community-driven effort to create
and maintain a registry of unique faculty identifiers and a transparent method
of linking research activities and outputs to these identifiers”
(http://orcid.org/content/initiative). 
•	As reliance on automated data sources increases, the problem of name
ambiguity combined with incomplete data about scholarly works creates a
situation where many faculty may not receive proper attribution for the full
range of their scholarly contributions. ORCID attempts to solve this problem
by creating unique faculty ids that can be linked to existing identifiers as
well as to publisher manuscript submission systems, funding agency grant
application workflows, and other tools. 
•	Unlike other identifier systems, ORCID is open and community-driven,
and reaches across disciplines, geographic regions, and types of content held
by publishers, journals, and funding agencies to include all types of scholar
works (e.g., articles, books, data sets, grants, software, etc.). 
Questions? 
See the campus ORCID project website:
http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/ScholarlyCommunications/ORCID/. 
Contact members of the project team by email at orcidsupport@school.edu or
call Faculty Affairs at 303-111-1111. 
This project is funded by a grant from the Sloan Foundation, supported by the
Provost and jointly managed by the Office of Faculty Affairs and the Dean of
the Libraries.
